# Javascript

This week, we do our first proper dive into making our webpages *do* things with *Javascript*.

We start by learning basic Javascript syntax and data types. We shortly follow that by introducing our first Javascript framework, *[jQuery](http://jquery.com)*.

We'll also unlock full interactivity by introducing form elements, like `<input>`.
