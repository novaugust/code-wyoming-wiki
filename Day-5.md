CSS Shapes As A Mockup
--------------

We're going to start off by building [this CSS Shapes webpage](https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/)

From there, start exploring. Try coming up with your own webpage, or check out some of these examples for [inspiration](http://mashable.com/2007/09/13/one-column-website-templates/).

Do one webpage with a background-image in the header, one with a fixed background-image, and one with a normal (scroll) background-image.
