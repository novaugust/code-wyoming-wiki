# Website Layouts
Week two is our first foray into actual webpages. We'll work on making authentic webpages with techniques we learn in the Layouts section. This week is project heavy as we finally bring together all the things we've learned to make webpages.

As our projects become more complex, we'll become more reliant on GitHub.

We'll also continue to learn new CSS properties throughout the week.
