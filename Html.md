Line Break
----------------
Line breaks aren't for general purpose formatting. Instead, they are for text that belongs together in a single paragraph tag, but that thematically needs to be on separate lines.
Examples are:

* Poetry
* Addresses
```html
<p class="address">
  Mozilla Foundation<br>
  1981 Landings Drive<br>
  Building K<br>
  Mountain View, CA 94043-0801<br>
  USA
</p>
```
[Example via](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/br "Mozilla Developer Network - Line Break")

Horizontal Rule
----------------
>In HTML5, the horizontal rule element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements (for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section)
