#### Lists CSS

Because links in navigation can be thought of as a list of links, the web standard is to put them in ul. We then need to customize things pretty heavily to get our links to look how we want.

* `list-style-type`
    * none
    * disc
    * circle
    * square
    * upper-alpha
    * lower-alpha
    * lower-roman

* `list-style-image` uses `url(...)`
* `list-style-position` 
    * `inside`
    * `outside` (default)

And most importantly
##### Display: Inline-block
We're familiar with `inline` and `block`, now let's use the hybrid, `inline-block`

    The element will display as an inline display element adjacent to other inline display elements, but can also be configured with properties of block display elements (namely, `width` and `height`).

Did we ever say that inline elements can't have their width and height configured?

###### Project: Build a horizontal nav menu.
