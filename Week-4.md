# Frameworks

This week, we learn to use web-developer tools like Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and other frameworks to help us quickly prototype websites without reinventing the wheel.
As we become comfortable with using Bootstraps more complicated features (powered by javascript), we'll begin to delve into writing Javascript for the first time.

### Frameworks
Frameworks are tools created by web developers for web developers. They keep us from needing to reinvent the wheel with every webpage.

#### Font Awesome
Awesome icons from Font Awesome! So awesome!

#### Bootstrap
Bootstrap began as an open source project by Twitter, and has become arguably the most 

##### Helpers
To start with, we will focus on learning to use Bootstrap's helper classes, like `pull-right` or `text-center` to help speed up our prototyping.

##### The Grid
Once we're feeling comfortable with the idea of using other peoples CSS, we will move on to using Bootstrap's grid to create responsive layouts.

##### Components
* Carousel
* Dropdowns
* Navbars

### Basic jQuery
We'll sneak in some jQuery based javascript as the week progresses.
