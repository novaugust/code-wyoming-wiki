# Mobile Design
This week focuses on learning to use Media Queries, which allow us to write different CSS properties for differently-sized screens. 
We'll also work on creating more reusable CSS that allows us to easily work on our html.
Html will be finished up this week as we learn about forms and tables.

### Media Queries
This is the emphasis for the week. We will be writing a lot of CSS to get our websites ready for display on both mobile and desktop displays.

### Tables
We skipped these before. Tables use lots of arbitrary elements, but should be dead-simple for us at this point.

### CSS on the Bleeding Edge
We'll learn properties that the people who interview you for your next job won't know how to use. Well, aside from `transition`.

* transition
* transform
* animation
* flexbox
