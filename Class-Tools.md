[Google Chrome][Chrome]
==================
A browser with powerful developer tools that help us see inside our code.

[Brackets][Brackets]
==================
A web development IDE that plugs right into Chrome. We additionally use the following extensions.

Plugins we use:

* Beautify

    Helps us keep our code well formatted, making it easier to read and find mistakes.
* Emmet

    Makes writing html go much, much quicker.
    Don't use it until you have a grasp of how to do html by hand, though.
* Brackets Git

   Integrates Git(below) with Brackets

[Git][Git]
==================
Git is a popular version control tool that every web developer needs to know how to use.

We use Git to keep track of our projects' histories. That allows us to try new things without worrying about breaking something that works.
We also use Git, in combination with GitHub (see below), to easily share and collaborate on our projects.

[GitHub][GitHub]
==================
You're looking at it right now!
From the GitHub website:

>GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over four million people use GitHub to build amazing things together.

At its core, GitHub is powered by Git. Git and GitHub combine to keep the world of web development running smoothly. It's a must-know for web developers, and free to use.

We use GitHub to share our code with each other, and to collaborate on projects.

The Command Prompt
==================
The command prompt is what you see "hackers" typing into in movies.

![Command Prompt][prompt]

It's the quickest, most powerful way to interact with developer tools like Git.
The command prompt will also reinforce file system naviation.
