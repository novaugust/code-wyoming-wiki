### Positioning
Today we learn a new layout technique, positioning, which utilizes the `position` property.

#### Position: Static
This is the default

#### Position: Fixed
This is how we do "sticky" navbars and headers.

##### Offsets
* `top`
* `right`
* `bottom`
* `left`

##### Fixed Projects
Fix the nav element on the brochure.

Fix the header on Casey's Project.

### Positioning: Absolute
This is the most powerful, and thus trickiest, of the position values.
