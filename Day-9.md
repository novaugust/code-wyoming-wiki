### Positioning
Today we learn a new layout technique, positioning, which utilizes the `position` property.

#### Position: Static
This is the default

#### Position: Relative
Setting a position to relative does not immediately do anything we can detect. `position` actually works in conjunction with the __TRBL Offsets__, a series of four properties.

* `top`
* `right`
* `bottom`
* `left`
