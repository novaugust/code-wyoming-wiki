Protocols
-----------
Loosely defined, protocols are rules for communication between computers. Quite a few work together to make the internet do its thing.
* Email protocols (SMTP / POP / IMAP)
* HTTP(S)
* FTP
* TCP/IP
* IP & IPv6

URLs
-----------
http://www.example.com/stuff/index.html
### Five parts:
1. protocol (http)
2. server name / subdomain (www)
3. domain name (example.com)
4. folder name (stuff)
5. file name (index.html)

You'll sometimes see the domain name followed by a colon and series of numbers, like so
    http://localhost:1337
That's called a _port number_. 

They're like PO boxes for your computer, making sure your request gets delivered to the right application. More on those later.

### TLDs
-Top Level Domains-
.com, .org, .net, .io, and on and on, are all examples of TLDs. More and more TLDs are coming into existence all the time, like .xxx, .book, .kitchen ([no, seriously](http://www.gimmetheknife.kitchen/ "Gimme the knife DOT kitchen")).

### DNS
Associates IP addresses domain names


Web Development
-----------
* Front-side vs back-side
* What it isn't (other kinds of development)

### HTML, CSS, JS
How do they all work together
