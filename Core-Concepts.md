What is the internet
--------------------

[How does the internet work?](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/internet.htm)
### Servers & Clients

### Protocols
Loosely defined, protocols are rules for communication between computers. Quite a few work together to make the internet do its thing.
* Email protocols (SMTP / POP / IMAP)
* HTTP(S)
* FTP
* TCP/IP
* IP & IPv6

### TLDs
-Top Level Domains-
.com, .org, .net, .io, and on and on, are all examples of TLDs. More and more TLDs are coming into existence all the time, like .xxx, .book, .kitchen ([no, seriously](http://www.gimmetheknife.kitchen/ "Gimme the knife DOT kitchen")).
[List of TLDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains "Wikipedia list of TLDs")

### DNS
Domain name system: A system for translationg domain names (TLDs!) into IP addresses.

### URLs
http://www.example.com/stuff/index.html
#### Five parts:
1. protocol (http)
2. server name / subdomain (www)
3. domain name (example.com)
4. folder name (stuff)
5. file name (index.html)

You'll sometimes see the domain name followed by a colon and series of numbers, like so

    http://localhost:1337

That's called a _port number_. 

They're like PO boxes for your computer, making sure your request gets delivered to the right application. More on those later.

### Browsers

### Front End and Back End
TeamTreeHouse has a [great writeup](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/i-dont-speak-your-language-frontend-vs-backend) on the Front vs Back jargon.

### HTML, CSS, JS
